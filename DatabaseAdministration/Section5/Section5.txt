BASIC SQL COMMANDS
What is a SQL Statement and types of SQL statements
SQL Statements defined 
-SQL is used to communicate with a database. It is the standard language for relational database management 
systems.
-SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a 
database.

TYPES OF SQL STATEMENTS
-DML (Data Manipulation Language)
-DDL (Data Definition Language)
-DCL (Data Control Language)
-TCL (Transaction Control Language)

DML statements with examples
-DML is short for Data Manipulation Language
-deals with data manipulation, and includes most common SQL statements such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, 
DELETE, ect.
it is used to store, modify, retrieve, delete and update data in a database.

SELECT statement 
-the SELECT statement is used to select records from the table, with or without a condition.
-secect*from student ------ this gets all records of student table.
-secect*from student where rank > 5 ------------ gets records with the condition where students rank 
is greater than 5.

INSERT statement 
-insert statement is used to insert a set of values into a database table. insert statemets are used with 
values.
-insert into Student (Rank,StudentName,Mark) Values (1,'Pranav',450)

UPDATE statement 
-the UPDATE statement is ude to update exsisting values in a table, which is based on some condition.
-update student set StudentName='Abbas' where StudentName-'Imran'
-the query given above will update the student Name from Imran to Abbas

DELETE statement
-delete statement is used to delete the exsisting record in the table, which is based on some condition.
-Delete from Student where StudentName='Abbas'
-the query above will delete records which has StudentName as Abbas.

DDL statements with examples
-DDL is short for Data Definition Language
-it deals with database schemas and descriptions
-How the data should reside in the database
-CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE.

CREATE statement 
-is used to create a new table in an existing database. Create statement is also used to create 
other database objects such as a stored procedure, function.
- create Table Student (Rank Int, StudentName varchar(50), Mark Float)

ALTER statement
-alter statement can add a column, modify a column, drop a column, rename a column or rename a table
-alter Tble Student Add (StudentAddress varchar(100))

DROP statement
-is used to remove a table definition and all the data, indexes, triggers, constraints and 
permission specifications for the table.
-Drop table student
-Drop database AdventureWorks

TRUNCATE statement 
-TRUNCATE SQL query removes all rows froma table, without logging the individual row deletions.
-once truncate is executed you cannot retrive the data unlike the DELETE STATEMENT 
(with this you can, with delete statement you can delete a certian row using the were class but with 
truncat you cannot use the were class).
-Truncate Table Tabel_Name

DCL STATEMENTS 
-DCL is short for DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE
-it defines the control over the data in the database.
-GRANT, REVOKE

GRANT statements 
-GRANT statement used to grant SQL SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, and other privileges on tables or views.
-GRANT UPDATE ON ORDER_BACKLOG TO JONES WITH GRANT OPTION 
-GRANT SELECT ON TABLE Q.STAFF TO PUBLIC

REVOKE statement 
-used to cancel previously granted or denied permissions.
-REVOKE DELETE ON employees FROM anderson;
-REVOKE ALL ON employees FROM anderson;

TCL statements 
-TCL is short fot Transactions Control Language.
-These commands are used to manage the transactions in the database.
-Used to manage the changes made by DML statements.
-It also allows the statements to be grouped together into logical transactions.

COMMIT statements 
-commit command is used to permanemtly save any transaction into the database.
-when we use Commit in any query then the changes made by that query will be permanent and visible.
-begin tran d 
 update emp set empName-'D' where empid=11
 commit tran d

ROLLBACK statements
-Rollback is used to undo changes made by any command but onlu before a commit is done.
-We cannot Rollback data which has been committed in the database with the help of the commit keyword.

SAVEPOINT statement 
-SAVEPOINT command is used to temporarily save a transaction so that you can roll back to that point 
whenever necessary.
-Savepoint names must be distinct within a given transaction.
-After a savepoint has been created, you can either continue processing, commit your work, 
roll back the entire transaction, or roll back to the savepoint.
